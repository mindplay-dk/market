======

This project will provide a comparison of features of Markdown parser implementations
for PHP, by running a matrix of input/output tests against different libraries with
different configurations, extensions, etc.

You can see which adapters and tests are currently bootstrapped [here](src/SuiteFactory.php).

There is no meaningful output yet, so don't get your hopes up - there's a lot of work left
to make the results presentable.

### TO DO

 * presentation
 * visual diff
 * persistent results (history)
